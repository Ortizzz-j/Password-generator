# Password Generator Using Javascript


## The Work

    In this project I was able to write code that generated a password using the selected options that were prompted in an alert on the page. The code concatenates using the criteria selected by the user, randomizes it and pushes it out back into the html and into the HTML. The code starts the page with the prompts and re-displays them when the user clicks generate password.
